Analysis of Moberly Lake data

The purpose of this repo is to track the clean-up of old scripts and make sure I don't break anything. 

These scripts communicate with an MS Access Database on file in the NE region so it is not yet reproducible. The script pretty much just dumps the tables into R to manipulate, rather than communicating with the db in an ongoing way.

Steps/goals: 
1- clean up old script using tidyverse language
2- take out anything useless
3- make sure all of this works in an .RProj
